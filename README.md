# MNIST-CNN-Python
 Implementation of convolutional neural networks to solve mnist using python without the use of PyTorch or TensorFlow.
 Results max out at around 90% accuracy(Terrible) - an increase from 60% until implenting He Initialization using the solution provided in "On weight initialization in deep neural networks"(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08863.pdf)
Solution uses ReLu -> Softmax with cross entropy loss, still maxing out at 90%
